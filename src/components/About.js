      <p> DogDaze began as a small, humble business before becoming one of the world's leading dog management applications. Niani Byrd founded DogDaze in 2021 after finding it difficult to keep track of all of her dogs. One dog needed medication twice daily, and the other needed a more frequent bathroom schedule. It became difficult to keep up! 
          <br></br><br></br>

        Use DogDaze for anything your dog's heart may desire. From silly to serious, make sure your dogs are having their needs met. You are their entire world!
